# Artificial Neural Networks

It consists of a supervised learning algorithm, that consists of the reception of input and computation of a function with weights (in layers).

So, given the input matrix ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X), and weights ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{W} = \{w_j\}_{j=1}^N) and bias ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w_0) we have the **activation function** ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=g: \mathbb{R}^{N+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^M):
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{y} = g(w_0 + \mathbf{X}^T W ))

It can sort of mimmic a natural brain neural net, because of its structure with neurons and connections between them.
